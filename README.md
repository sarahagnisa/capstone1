# **Client - Procurement Management System (CPMS)**

** Preface
This project was created as part of the Capstone Module 1 for the Purwadhika Data Science & Machine Learning Program. The goal is to practice foundational Python programming skills by developing a functional, real-world terminal-based application. The system simulates the management of procurement data in an organization.

# Introduction
The Client - Procurement Management System (CPMS) is a Python-based application that helps users manage procurement records such as computers, furniture, and other assets. Built with simple Python libraries like datetime and tabulate, this CLI-based system allows users to view, add, edit, and delete procurement data.
The application uses dictionaries as a data structure to simulate a lightweight in-memory database and is designed for learning purposes.
